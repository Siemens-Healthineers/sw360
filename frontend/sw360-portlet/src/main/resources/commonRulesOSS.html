    <li class="pl-2"><b>Obligations and risk assessment regarding distribution</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li class="pl-2">Ensure that your distribution terms
            which are agreed with Siemens' customers (e.g. standard terms, "AGB",
            or individual agreements) define that the open source license
            conditions shall prevail over the Siemens' license conditions with
            respect to the open source software. E.g. the new modular “Siemens
            Healthineers General Terms” as of 2022 contain appropriate language.</li>
        <li class="pl-2">Do not use any names, trademarks,
            service marks or product names of the author(s) and/or licensors to
            endorse or promote products derived from this software component
            without the prior written consent of the author(s) and/or the owner
            of such rights.</li>
        <li class="pl-2">Consider for your product/project if you accept the general risk that</li>
        <ul>
            <li class="pl-2">it cannot be verified whether
                contributors to open-source software are legally permitted to
                contribute (the code could e.g. belong to his employer, and not the
                developer). Usually, disclaimers or contribution policies exclude
                responsibility for contributors even to verify the legal status.</li>
            <li class="pl-2">there is no warranty or liability
                from the community – i.e. error corrections must be made by Siemens,
                and Siemens must cover all damages.</li>
