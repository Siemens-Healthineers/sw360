    <li><b>Documentation of license conditions and copyright notices in

        ReadMe_OSS generated by SW360, please make sure you comply with the
        following requirements regarding the content of the README_OSS:
    </li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>All relevant open-source licenses,
            copyrights and acknowledgements for distributed code must be
            contained</li>
        <li class="pb-2">Licenses
            marked as "Do Not Use" must not be contained in the ReadMe_OSS</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Modifications in Source Code (if modifications are permitted)</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Do not change or delete Copyright,
            patent, trademark, attribution notices or any further legal notices
            or license texts in any files (e.g. by minification of JavaScript
            code) - i.e. neither within any source file of the component package
            nor in any of its documentclassation files.</li>
        <li class="pb-2">Document all
            changes and modifications in source code files with copyright notices
            formatted pursuant to Siemens Norm SN 11108.pdf, e.g. 'Â© Siemens Healthineers,
            [YEAR]'.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><b>Obligations and risk assessment regarding distribution</b></li>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Ensure that your distribution terms
            which are agreed with Siemens' customers (e.g. standard terms, "AGB",
            or individual agreements) define that the open source license
            conditions shall prevail over the Siemens' license conditions with
            respect to the open source software.</li>
        <li>Do not use any names, trademarks,
            service marks or product names of the author(s) and/or licensors to
            endorse or promote products derived from this software component
            without the prior written consent of the author(s) and/or the owner
            of such rights.</li>
        <li>Consider for your product/project
            if you accept the general risk that it cannot be verified whether
            contributors to open source software are legally permitted to
            contribute (the code could e.g. belong to his employer, and not the
            developer). Usually, disclaimers or contribution policies exclude
            responsibility for contributors even to verify the legal status.</li>
